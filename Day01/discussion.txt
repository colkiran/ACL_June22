--------------

Open source technology - source code is available free of cost


till 2010 - PERL  - PERL and CGI - first Web Application
				   - PERL - Regular Expression

Desktop Application - TK -(python and TK (tool kit)) GUI

Web Application - MVC Framework - MVT (Django Framework)
				 - REST API - Django, Flask

Mobile App - Kivy 

Testing - Pytest, selenium

ETL - petl (extraction transformation and loading)

DataScience - Data Analytics, ML, AI


Perl and Python
---------------
1. perl has made use of special variables to write code

2. Python has ready made functions to handle things


Flavours of Python
------------------

1. Cpython 		- currently using

2. Jython		- Python code to Java Code

3. Iron Python - Python code to communicate with dot net libraries


Versions of Python
------------------

2.x and 3.x

2.x
---
print "hello world"

3.x
---
print("Hello World")


Editors
-------

1. Notepad++
2. pycharm CE - Open source
3. Visual Studio Code CE
4. Sublime
5. Jupyter Notebook
6. spyder
7. google colabs


Paid
----
Pycharm Studio
Komodo


python 3.10.5
-------------
1. Python SDK - Libraries used to execute the python code

2. Python Shell - python interactive Environment

3. IDLE - Interactive development Environment - 


Overloaded Operators
---------------------

+ => addition and concatenation

* => multiplication and print a string n number of times


Modules are libraries in other technologies and they have the same extension as a python file .py


import os (5 mb)

from os import system

system function will become local to the enviroment => 


library 	- imp
function 	- reload

from imp import reload

Coding Rules
------------
#! c:\python39


#! -> shebang			-> gives us the path of python.exe

Coding Rules
-------------
comments
--------
# is used for comments in python, we can comment a single line with #


strings enclosed
----------------

strings are enclosed in "  " or '  ' for a single line string

multiline strings are enclose in '''     ''' or  """     """

we use these in doc strings - description of a function 


Python does not rely on paranthesis for functions, if conditions and for loops instead it works on 
indentation

def fun():
	print("Function code")
	for i in range(1, 11):
		print("For loop code")
		if i mod 2 == 0:
			print("if condition code")
			print(i)
	

Data Types
----------
1. Numbers
	a. integers
	b. float
	c. complex
2. Strings
3. Boolean																																																			

Variables in python
-------------------
variables should either start with an alphabet or an underscore but not with a number

5 =>	0101
3 => 	0011
		----
		0110



0101 => 0101 << 1

		1010

Loops and Control Sturctures
----------------------------

control structures
------------------
1. if condition
2. select case (not supported)


loops
-----
1. for loop
2. while loop

print
-----
print(data, sep=, end="\n")


1. print the pattern

1 2 3 4 5
 1 2 3 4

1! = 1
2! = 2
145! = 1! + 4! + 5!
	 = 1 + 24 + 120
     = 145
